Hadoop:
Hadoop is an open source framework which stores large amount of data i.e. HDFS & it process distribued data in parallel i.e. MapReduce over a cluster of commodity computers using a programming model.

5 Vs:
1) Volume: Size of data
2) Velocity: Speed of data
3) Variety: Structured/Unstructured/Semi-Structured
4) Veracity: Data Anamolies
id	name	city
1	arif	pune
arif	bnglr	2
hyd		arif
		shivam
5) Value: ROI

DFS: Distributed File System

Advantages of Hadoop:
1) Data Locality --> Distributed Processing
2) Fault Tolerant
3) Reliable/Highly Available

Disadvantage of Hadoop:
1) Lengthy Code --> Java
WordCount --> Java --> 70-80 Lines
WordCount --> Spark --> 2-3 Lines -> 10 to 100 times faster than Hadoop.
2) Small File

Jigsaw VM Installation: Completed

Hadoop 1.x Architecture: Completed
It understands from which machine the request is coming?
What size that request is?
How many blocks it is getting divided into?
Which DN are working/responsible for processing data?
Which DN are responsible for Replica?

Hadoop 2.x Architecture: Completed

HDFS Commands:

start-all.sh	==> Start Hadoop Daemons/Services
jps		==> To check Java Process Running
Ctrl + L		==> Clear the Screen
Ctrl + Shift + T	==> To Open a New Tab in Terminal

1) -mkdir: It creates a directory
hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/hduser/HFS
hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/hduser/HFS/Input
hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/hduser/HFS/Output

2) -ls: It lists files & directories in the working directory
hdfs dfs -ls /user/hduser/HFS

3) -copyFromLocal: It copies file from Local to Hadoop
hdfs dfs -copyFromLocal /home/hduser/LFS/datasets/file1.txt /user/hduser/HFS/Input/
hdfs dfs -ls /user/hduser/HFS/Input/

4) -put: It copies file from Local to Hadoop
hdfs dfs -put /home/hduser/LFS/datasets/file2.txt /user/hduser/HFS/Input/
hdfs dfs -ls /user/hduser/HFS/Input/

5) -cat: To view the contents from a file
hdfs dfs -cat /user/hduser/HFS/Input/file1.txt

6) -copyToLocal: It copies file from Hadoop to Local
hdfs dfs -copyToLocal /user/hduser/HFS/Input/file1.txt /home/hduser/LFS/datasets/ 

7) -get: It copies file from Hadoop to Local
hdfs dfs -get /user/hduser/HFS/Input/file2.txt .

8) -touchz: It creates a zero byte file
hdfs dfs -touchz /user/hduser/HFS/Input/emp_file.txt
hdfs dfs -ls /user/hduser/HFS/Input/emp_file.txt

9) -appendToFile: It appends the data to the file if available else it creates a new file.
hdfs dfs -appendToFile /home/hduser/LFS/datasets/file1.txt /user/hduser/HFS/Input/emp_file.txt

10) -rm: It removes a file from Hadoop Directory
hdfs dfs -rm /user/hduser/HFS/Input/emp_file1.txt
hdfs dfs -ls /user/hduser/HFS/Input/
