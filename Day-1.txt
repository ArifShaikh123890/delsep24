Differences Between Git & GitHub:
		Git			GitHub
1) Git is a tool to execute version control.		GitHub is a platform which utilizes Git to carry out its
					functionalites.
2) It is s/w which needs to be installed.		It is a web based platform we don't need to install BUT
					we need to create an account in order to use.
3) It is a CLI				It is a GUI

Git Life Cycle:

Git Commands:
1) git init: It initializes your working directory & it creates 2 things
a) It assigns a default branch: master
b) It creates a hidden folder: .git

2) git status: It displays all tracked/untracked/modified files.

3) git add: It adds your untracked files to the staging area which are ready to be committed & now they are tracked.

4) git commit: It records the files changes permanently & also it gives a version.

5) git log: It will show you all logs for the file.

6) git diff: If you want to know what data changes has been made to a file.

7) git commit -a -m "": Skipping your Stage Area.
		We cannot do this on a new file.
		At least once the file should be committed.
