DataFrame:
1) DataFrame is a distributed collection of data organized into rows & columns.
2) DataFrame appeared in Spark Release 1.3.0.
3) DataFrame contains rows with Schema & it has in-built optimization.
4) The features common to RDD and DataFrame are immutability, in-memory and distributed computing capability.
5) It allows the user to impose the structure onto a distributed collection of data.
6) We can build DataFrame from different data sources. For e.g. structured data file, tables in Hive, external databases or existing RDDs.

Limitations of Spark RDD:
1) It does not have any built-in optimization engine.
2) It does not have schema.
Thus to overcome these limitations, DataFrame came into existence.

# Write Modes:
# 1) error: If the dir is not available it will create dir else it will give error.
# 2) ignore: If the dir is not avaialbe it will create dir else it will ignore
# 3) append: If the dir is not avaialbe it will create dir else it will append data 
            # to existing dir.
# 4) overwrite: If the dir is not avaialbe it will create dir else it will overwrite the
            # existing dir.
